# TPO Management System - Development Guide

## üéì **Learning-Focused Development Approach**

This guide outlines our step-by-step approach to building the TPO Management System backend with proper understanding at each stage.

## üéØ **Development Philosophy**

### **Core Principles:**
1. **Understand Before Code** - Explain concepts before implementation
2. **One Block at a Time** - Small, manageable pieces
3. **Test and Verify** - See everything working before moving forward
4. **Ask Questions** - Clarify understanding at each step
5. **Connect the Dots** - Show how pieces fit together

### **Learning Depth Levels:**
- **Concept Level**: What we're building and why
- **Design Level**: How we structure the solution
- **Implementation Level**: Writing the actual code
- **Testing Level**: Verifying it works correctly
